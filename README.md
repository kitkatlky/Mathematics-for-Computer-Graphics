# Mathematics-for-Computer-Graphics
The course will equip and develop the mathematical foundation used in the field of Computer Graphics. Variety of mathematical core concepts and techniques are required to compose the computer graphics algorithms. Throughout the semester, students are shown the mathematical tools relevant to computer graphics which will guide them to solve the real mathematical problem in developing any Computer Graphics system.


ASSIGNMENT 1 My Vector Calculator
[REPORT ASSIGNMENT_1.pdf](https://github.com/kitkatlky/Mathematics-for-Computer-Graphics/files/7598290/REPORT.ASSIGNMENT_1.pdf)

DESCRIPTION: Assignment 1 aims to strengthen both your fundamental knowledge in Mathematic Computer Graphics and basic programming skill in Python.

INSTRUCTION: 
Build and develop an interactive Basic CG Calculator. The calculator will include all operations in vector such as arithmetic operations, scalar product, dot product and so on. Creativity, uniqueness and interactive application will score high marks. Your application must be unique. Any obvious similarity with others might get zero marks. The way you construct your button/menu arrangement must be unique and creative as well. You can add text/sound/background music/popup info or anything to differentiate your application.



ASSIGNMENT 2 My Matrix Calculator
[ASSIGNMENT 2 REPORT.pdf](https://github.com/kitkatlky/Mathematics-for-Computer-Graphics/files/7598309/ASSIGNMENT.2.REPORT.pdf)

DESCRIPTION
Assignment 2 aims to strengthen your knowledge in matrix calculation and programming skill in Python.

INSTRUCTION
Build and develop an interactive Basic CG Calculator. The calculator will include all operations related with matrix such as arithmetic operations, determinant, inverse matrix, transpose matrix, scalar triple product and so on. Besides that, your calculator should include series and individual of transformation functions (translation, rotation, scaling, shear reflection and Composite Transformation for 2D only). Your calculator must be unique. Any obvious similarity with others might get zero marks. Your design for user interface must be unique and creative as well. You can add text/sound/background music/popup info or anything to differentiate your developed application.



ASSIGNMENT 3 Computer Graphics Calculator

DESCRIPTION: Assignment 3 aims to improve your previous calculator by adding several computer graphics mathematical features.

INSTRUCTION: 
Develop an interesting Computer Graphics Calculator that include Gram-Schmidt Orthogonalization, Euler computation and previous assignments (vector and matrix operations).
Your produced calculator must be unique. Any obvious similarity with others might get zero marks. The way you construct your button/menu arrangement must be unique and creative as well. You can add text/sound/background music/popup info or anything to differentiate your developed application.
