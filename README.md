# Mathematics-for-Computer-Graphics
The course will equip and develop the mathematical foundation used in the field of Computer Graphics. Variety of mathematical core concepts and techniques are required to compose the computer graphics algorithms. Throughout the semester, students are shown the mathematical tools relevant to computer graphics which will guide them to solve the real mathematical problem in developing any Computer Graphics system.


ASSIGNMENT 1 My Vector Calculator

DESCRIPTION: Assignment 1 aims to strengthen both your fundamental knowledge in Mathematic Computer Graphics and basic programming skill in Python.

INSTRUCTION: Build and develop an interactive Basic CG Calculator. The calculator will include all operations in vector such as arithmetic operations, scalar product, dot product and so on. Creativity, uniqueness and interactive application will score high marks. Your application must be unique. Any obvious similarity with others might get zero marks. The way you construct your button/menu arrangement must be unique and creative as well. You can add text/sound/background music/popup info or anything to differentiate your application.
